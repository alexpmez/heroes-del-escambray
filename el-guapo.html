                            He's about half a century old, but he looks younger. His hair is black and thick. His face has no wrinkles or cracks. His body is solid, although the right leg looks thicker than the left.

                            Agapito Rivera Mili&#225;n, who arrived in Miami in May 1988, has dedicated his life to the fight for freedom in Cuba. For the last two and a half decades he has been a defiant political prisoner, one of the most intransigent who has confronted the system.
                            Before being incarcerated, he was for three years a guerrilla commander in Las Villas, receiving five wounds in combats against the guerrilla hunters, of the special troops of the Castro army.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They called him El Guapo Rivera, for his recklessness, because he fought bravely, breaking many enemy encirclement head-on, on his feet, firing his Browning machine gun against the enemy's host. At 23 years of age, wanting to rise against the communist
                            regime, but lacking military experience and weapons, enlisted in the government militia. At four o'clock on the afternoon of October 2, 1960, El Guapo was given a Springfield rifle and a cannon with 91 bullets. At nine o'clock
                            at night he rose up against the regime.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In the bush, he rubbed shoulders with Campitos, with Mart&#237; Campos and Negro Tondike. El Guapo became a guerrilla leader in the northern circuit of Las Villas, from Sagua La Grande to Corralillo. He was wounded for the first time in a combat on April
                            25, 1962, when a machine-gun bullet pierced his right leg. In that same fight his younger brother, Stanislaus, was wounded three times, captured and executed. El Guapo survived miraculously, running several kilometers with
                            his bleeding leg, breaking the encirclement of the Castro’s militia.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Guapo Rivera was a headache for Castro's troops. Commander René de Los Santos led several operations against the guerrilla leader, but could not catch him. Commander Lizardo Proenza, one of the main leaders of the LCB, failed three times in trying
                            to catch El Guapo, who escaped through the cracks of the huge triple encirclements of Castro’s troops. On one occasion, despite being trapped inside the encirclement for two nights and three days, El Guapo managed to escape
                            again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On November 21, Agapito Rivera, his brother Francisco, and another guerrilla called Mayito Garc&#237;a Molina camped in a sugarcane field. Lizardo Proenza then launched his fourth offensive against El Guapo. The LCB hunters closed a encirclement on the
                            area. All the sugarcane fields near the hiding place where the rebels were, were saturated by Castro’s patrols setting up ambushes. The embankment were sealed by well-armed platoons. Guerrilla hunters of the special troops
                            began combing the fields in search of the three guerrillas.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The three guerrillas left the sugarcane field exchanging fire with the enemy. A bullet hit El Guapo in the right arm, but the guerrilla leader continued firing. At about two kilometers from where the scuffle began, the three guerrillas ran into an ambush
                            in a sugarcane field. Both sides fired at point-blank range. Francisco, El Guapo's brother, collapsed. A bullet pierced his chest. Another bullet entered through the back and came out through the navel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Leaving behind the corpse of his second brother, El Guapo and Mayito left the sugarcane field, pursued by a cloud of bullets.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When jumping a fence, Mayito was destroyed by a burst of machine gun. Moments later, a second bullet broke El Guapo’s right arm. Unable to fire his machine-gun, Agapito crossed a running militia line, eluding the bullets at point-blank range.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He entered a sugarcane field. The LCB hunters fired hundreds of bullets on the fleeing figure. A bullet lodged in his right leg, but El Guapo kept running. Another bullet entered the left leg, splitting the femoral. Within the cane field El Guapo Rivera
                            collapsed on the Villare&#241;a land.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Then there was a miracle. A man with a bullet in the femoral should bleed in a couple of minutes. But El Guapo had a clotted venous clot in his groin, a miraculous fistula that prevented the blood from circulating freely and the wounded from bleeding.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            El Guapo hid in the sugarcane field. Unable to fire the rifle, he pulled the .45 pistol from his holster and raked it. He sat down to wait for his last fight, but the special troops did not dare to enter the sugarcane field to look for the dangerous wounded
                            man. Time passed and the minutes became hours. El Guapo was a ball of mud and blood. He lit a cigarette, perhaps the last smoke of his life, and bit it hard, chewing the end between his teeth. The weakness of the blood loss
                            caused him a drunken stupor. He fell asleep, losing consciousness, to wake up minutes later. His vision would go away and come back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After three hours the guerrilla hunters entered the sugarcane field. They found El Guapo unconscious, they disarmed him and took him to an embankment. El Guapo woke up in time to feel his trousers and shirt being rip, so his wounds could be heal. A soldier
                            tore the tobacco from his mouth. Others called cursed at him. After bandaging it, they were going to throw him into the bed of a truck, pulling on hi hair to make him stand up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            El Guapo could barely speak, but asked in a whisper for the guerrilla hunters to finish him off. Several made fun of him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Lizardo Proenza, the LCB commander who had chased El Guapo, fired a flurry of his Belgian FAL rifle into the air.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "Mother Fuckers!" Proenza shouted at his men. “Pussies! None of you wanted to fight him when he was inside the sugarcane field. Cowards and pussies! Treat him with respect, because he is a real man”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With his four wounds, El Guapo was taken to a hospital. The doctors examined him perplexed, amazed that with a bullet in the femoral bone he had not bled. A Soviet doctor and thirteen Cuban doctors visited him to study his case. He survived numerous operations
                            and faced the presidio with patriotic stoicism.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Although by Law 988 Agapito was supposed to has been executed, by a miracle he was condemned to thirty years of imprisonment instead of being sentenced to the firing squad. In addition to the 25 years of his defiance attitude as a political prisoner,
                            and five bullet wounds in his body, El Guapo lost two brothers and nine cousins ​​in the guerrilla struggle of the 1960s.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            El Guapo, Agapito Rivera Mili&#225;n, is of the guerrilla leader who survived, the one who stood for the longest time fighting against Castro’s regime, and the only active sector leader in Las Villas in 1963, who still lives to tell about the heroic uprisings
                            of the sixties.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The nickname of “El Guapo” is well deserved.
