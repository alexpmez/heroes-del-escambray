                        Commander Jos&#233; Mart&#237; Campos Linares, former Lieutenant of Castro’s Army, operated frequently in Matanzas in addition to directing the North Front of Las Villas, which operated from Corralillo to Sagua. Although Mart&#237; Campos was the undisputed head of more than two hundreds guerrillas, the most known guerrilla of that region was his father Benito Campos, known by Campito, whom the Castro regimen has accused of being a cattle rustler.

                        That accusation of rustler is pure regime propaganda. Campitos had a farm where he planted avocados and malanga and had chickens, goats and pigs. They accuse him of rustling but he was captain of the Castro’s Army in the fight against Batista. He was a good person and had a stack of children.

                        Brave and cunning, the former captain of the Rebel Army was one of the first conspirators against the Castro regime, he started fighting against the regime in 1960 with his children Chicho and Mart&#237;. His insurrection of the countryside was sponsored by the MRR.

                        Campitos was called by the Communists the snake, for his ability to avoid encirclements. The own regime declared that Campitos in the course of a month, was able to fight his way out and avoid twenty seven military operations. This detail gives us a panoramic view of who Campitos was, of his bravery and courage, since avoiding twenty-seven encirclements in thirty days is a superhuman feat.

                        <strong>Agapito &#8211;Guapo- Rivera</strong> <em> : In our area there were no military ranks. Mart&#237; was the commander in chief, the boss and all the other guerrillas…..the concept worked. One was a guerrilla leader because Mart&#237; assigned it, but there were no corporals, lieutenants or captains, and the number of men varied. I could get to meet with Mart&#237; and having ten, eleven men with me and then I went with four under my command and Cayo - my cousins brother - arrived with four and left with ten.

One of the most incredible encounters was when we broke a encirclement between Banaguises and San Jos&#233; The militia was on the train line and there, the train passed twice, at dawn and at night &#8230; in that area there was a lot of trees and the line of the train went many times around the field, and when we went to cross the fence they had a horse and the animal snorted and they detected us...the shooting was at point-blank range and it was very dark, we even kicked and hit each other with the rifle butts.... and in that very moment the train came and at times it illuminated everything and then absolute darkness, and it gave us light and more darkness, it was an incredible night. They wounded me in a thigh, but we broke the encirclement

                        For four years Campitos and his men kept the Castro forces in check, until only 14 of the guerrillas from Matanzas remained. The last guerrilla fighter already exhausted in its constant struggle against superior forces, was finally surrounded and annihilated.

                        On September 3, 1964, it was the penultimate encirclement in Los Arabos. That was brutal. They killed nine men and we killed several of them. In that encirclement our boss dies, Jos&#233; Mart&#237; Campos in combat. Died Reino Echenique that was a tremendous man. That day too, I lost my brother, Lazaro Ramos, who died breaking the encirclement and my brother in law, Nibaldo Vega…...It was a very hard moment….

                        On the next came the end, the final encirclement. We broke an encirclement where the LCB itself had his command and they came to encircle us in the area of ​​Rio Piedras and Colon. There were five of us: old Campitos-who was not that old, he was 57 years old, Cayo Rivera, Chicho Campos, Pablito Finales and finally me... There were several thousand militiamen and we were just five. The shooting started and Cayo dies and Chicho dies...imaging this nense, the old Campitos had lost two children in 24 hours. I did not see it, but the militia said that Campitos, wounded, committed suicide in a sugarcane plantation and that it should be true. They have preferred to kill him in combat or capture him but the old man did not give them the pleasure….

                        Pablito Finales and I crossed a part of the encirclement and found ourselves next to an abandoned country house where there was a crop of yucca and cane ... in that moment we heard how a small plane approached and Pablito said to me, "Macho, I'm going to shoot my self ... I said, "No, let's go, the plane is coming" and enter the sugarcane field and as soon as I hear a burst of fire. The plane passed overhead and I thought I had shot Pablito ... I left the sugarcane field to look for him and found hime face up, dead. He had been shot through the chin ... I followed and they ambushed me and they laid me down with a wound in the thigh of my right leg that bleed abundantly ... There they captured me. Commander Proenza was the one who directed the siege ... I was the last guerrilla in the province of Matanzas. I was the last to fall.
