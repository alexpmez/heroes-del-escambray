                    It was a brutal and long war, about which very little is known or written. In Cuba, from the early 1960s until the end of 1966, a few thousand humble and poorly armed peasants faced, in an unequal struggle, the military power of the regime of Fidel Castro.
                    Without adequate supplies, harassed by well-armed enemy hosts, the guerrillas were eventually defeated despite the fury and tenacity with which they fought.
                </p>

                <p>
                    More than two decades have elapsed since the stage of the guerrilla uprisings. Although these events affected the lives of hundreds of thousands of Cubans, very little has been written or documented on this stage. The Castro regime has published half
                    a dozen books and produced a couple of films on the subject of the uprisings, referring in a distorted way to the guerrillas as simple bandits. Although in some books, particularly those written by Jos&#233; Norberto Fuentes, admits
                    the bravery of the guerrillas, most of these editions have had very limited circulation within Cuba. Obviously, the regime of Fidel Castro has not had much interest in demonstrating that there was a problem. a strong opposition to
                    communism among the humblest men of Cuba, the peasants Cuban countryside.
                    <p>
                        In spite of all the difficulties, the stage of the guerrilla uprisings deserves to be deeply studied. Peasant war encompassed the six provinces of the Island, being the largest military campaign carried out in Cuba since the beginning of the Republic
                        in 1902. Since the spanish civil wars, it hasn't been such a fiercely fight on Cuban soil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The number of deaths in these years of combat will never be known with certainty. The Castro government rarely gave publicity, to details about battles or executions. The guerrillas, divided into groups, with poor communications between them, only the
                        knowledge of casualties in areas that limit them. Maintaining a census of the two was impossible for the insurgents. The executions, especially in Las Villas, were not only of guerrillas, but also included collaborators, contacts
                        in supply lines and some unfortunate peasants who were in the wrong place when the the Castro army patrolled the area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Not even the information sources of the regime are in agreement with the number of casualties suffered by their own forces. The writer Juan Carlos Fern&#225;ndez, in his book Everything is secret until a day, published in Cuba in 1976, gives the figure
                        of two hundred and ninety-five killed in combat suffered by operatives of the FAR (Revolutionary Armed Forces ) in the actions against the bandits. However in 1970, Ra&#250; l Castro. In a speech delivered at a commemorative ceremony
                        of the repressive apparatus of the MININT (Ministry of the Interior) he made a very significant allusion to the guerrilla struggle from 1960 to 1966, declaring that in the six provinces of Cuba a total of seventy-nine guerrilla
                        bands, composed of three thousand five hundred and ninety-one guerrillas.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As expressed by R. Castro in his speech, the cost of eliminating these groups arrived. to be almost eight hundred million pesos and cause the death, of almost five hundred men of the FAR. But, this number of Ra&#250;l Castro; Castro has been contradicted.
                        In the book We Were Imposed on Violence (Cuba, 1986), the author Jos&#233; Norberto Fuentes, details the cost of this war in about one billion pesos. This same author assures in one of his three books (Caza bandidos) that the special
                        units of the LCB (Fight Against Bandits) lost in combats in the province of Las Villas three hundred and five hunters. Since the number of Norberto Fuentes does not take into account the deaths of the FAR occurred between 1960
                        and 1962 in the two sieges (before the creation of the LCB) nor the casualties in the other five provinces, it is It is very possible that the number of deaths incurred by forces of the regime has been much greater than the figure
                        expressed by Ra&#250;l Castro in his 1970 speech.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        What we know, without discussion, is that the guerrilla struggle from 1960 to 1966, cost the lives of at least three thousand Cubans on both sides of the conflict, caused the imprisonment of thousands of others, and affect the life of an entire nation.
