                            They called him El Loco (The Crazy One). The nickname came because of his audacity, because his fearlessness and courage when confronting the enemy. Manolo L&#243;pez L&#243;pez was from Chambas, in the north of Camag&#252;ey. He was imprisoned when he was still a minor, accused of participating in guerrilla activities against the Castro regime. They sent him to Torrens, a jail for minors in Havana, to serve his sentence and receive political indoctrination.

                        <p>
                            But El Loco never served his sentence. With a knife he opened a gash in his stomach, next to the navel. They took him to a hospital, where the wound was sewn. And before returning to Torrens, El Loco tied a strip of sheets and threw himself through a window, losing himself in the darkness of the night.

                            Almost naked, wounded, and without resources, Manolito L&#243;pez managed to return to Camag&#252;ey, where he went back to the arm struggle. He turned 18 in the bush. He learned his guerrilla tactics from Rolando Mart&#237;n Amodia and Arnoldo Mart&#237;nez Andrade, two former officers of the Rebel Army who were the pioneers of the uprisings against Castroism in Camag&#252;ey. El Loco participated in many actions, including the assault on the Perea Mines, the capture of the towns of R&#237;o and Centeno, and numerous ambushes in the plains of the Province. By February 1962, despite his youth, he was a guerrilla commander, head of the rebels in Camag&#252;ey.

                            In the next six months, Manolito El Loco became one of the boldest guerrilla leaders in all of Cuba. The Castro’s themselves published stories that demonstrate the audacity of Manolito. In Boquer&#243;n, the communist militia ambushed the rebels. 'In the first fight a guerrilla died, Justo L&#243;pez Fuentes. Soon after, when the militia combed the area in search of the guerrillas, two shots were heard. Two militiamen collapsed. When the Castro troops arrived at the cliff from where the rebels had fired, they did not find guerrillas, but they did find a small sign hanging from a tree.

                            &#187;For every dead patriot, will take the lives of two militiamen.

                        <p>
                            The enemy thoroughly searched for Manolito El Loco. And he, with his madness and his audacity, continued to break encirclements. A lot of triple encirclements were closed on empty fields, while El Loco and his men crossed fields and pastures, evading the hunters of Castro’s special troops.

                            With fearlessness, El Loco L&#243;pez men carried out constant counter-attacks, despite being continually chase and harassed by Castro’s army. On June 29, 1962, with the communist militia on his heels, Manolito and his men stopped a bus in El Chorro. After killing two militants who were traveling in the vehicle, El Loco set the bus on fire.

                        <p>
                            On August 10 they surrounded him in Los Barriles. In the first combat, Manolito L&#243;pez was injured. One bullet caused a wound in his neck and another one pierced his hand. The guerrilla hunters threw a triple ring. For a week, hundreds of soldiers tracked the stones and cliffs, but found no trace of the eleven hidden guerrillas.

                        <p>
                            Oscar Figueredo, one of the chiefs of Castro’s special troops entered into a scree. There was El Loco. Leaning against some stones, the young guerrilla leader pointed calmly with his M-1 carbine. He pulled the trigger four times. Three bullets hit the target. A bullet embedded itself in Figueredo's belly. Two more, one on each nipple, destroyed the chest of Castro’s officer. Oscar Figueredo died instantly.

                        <p>
                            The encirclement of troops began to strangle the group of rebels. Floro Camacho, Manolito's lieutenant, helped him to escape. El Loco was weak. The wound on his neck had been covered with sap leaves, and the wound on his hand was infested. El Loco knew his time had come. With aplomb, the 19-year-old guerrilla chief handed over the leadership of the guerrilla to Floro Camacho, then he hid on some stones to cover the retreat of his men.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He drew enemy fire on himself to save his men. From the stones, he fired with his carbine M I and his 45 caliber pistol, to create confusion, so that Castro’s troops would think that there was more than one entrenched guerrilla fighting. They surrounded him. They fired at him with crossing fire and the bullets were cutting off branches and bursting stones.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            From the scree, El Loco shouted that he gave up, that he had run out of bullets. Several guerrilla hunters of special troops stopped to capture him, but were scattered by a hail of bullets. It was a trick. El Loco was not going to give up.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The shooting continued. From his hiding place, among stones eaten by the bullets, Manolito El Loco threw grenades at the encirclement of uniformed men kept coming closer and closer. While the young man was bleeding to death in the scree, Floro Camacho and the other guerrillas crossed the encirclement of troops that stretched for several kilometers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Two guerrilla hunters managed to approach the guerrilla. Two machine guns emptied their combs on the backs of the boy from Chambas. El Loco writhed among the stones and remained motionless.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Commander Manolito L&#243;pez L&#243;pez had died.
