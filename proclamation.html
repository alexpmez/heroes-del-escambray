                <p>
                    Cuba is in the time of war. The second war of independence is already being fought.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the mountains and in the plains, in the cities and in the fields, the Cubans brandish their weapons again to conquer their freedom.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As in '68, as in '95, Cubans return to face the yoke of a foreign power. This time against the grip of a strange despotism that has closed on Cuba and intends to close on America.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And Cuba is already fighting its battle again. Cuba, as before, small, alone; but as before firm, whole, standing. Ready to die before being a colony, rather than being a slave.
                </p>

                <p>
                    From the Eastern Sierras to the Pinar del Rio cordilleras, and fights again the homeland. And here, in the untamed peaks of the Escambray, the National Liberation Army shouts again: independence or death!
                </p>

                <p>
                    We do not believe ourselves heroes or like war. But we are Cubans who were born in Cuba, we love Cuba and we are not willing to be enslaved by a foreigner. We are Cubans who inherit a free homeland from the glorious mambises and are not willing to betray
                    the sacrifices of those marines, those heroes, allowing an Asian power to come and denigrate them and offend the flag they died for.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We know that Russians and Chinese are very powerful. We know that they have collaborators in Cuba. We know they have many weapons, many tanks, many rockets. but that doesn't intimidate us. Death can frighten those who do not mind living subdued betraying
                    their homeland; not to those who have learned with Mart&#237; "that it is preferable to die than to live on your knees".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The bad Cubans who are currently ungoverning us in complicity with the Russian and Chinese agents and occupiers, have surrendered the destinies of the fatherland. Fidel Castro, the Great Betrayer, could with the help of a whole people who believed in
                    his words, have made our country a great, prosperous nation, and of that people, a united, fraternal, sovereign people But preferred to surrender it to the strange yoke to satisfy his excessive ambition, his bastard commitments to
                    communism. Today the country has become crime, blood, suffering, fratricide. And what is worse: a foreign colony.
                </p>

                <p>
                    All the sacrifice of Agramonte and Cespedes is used by the Chinese. The Russians are the owners of the fruits of the land that fertilized Maceo's blood.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But here we are the Cubans to fight again for the kidnapped freedoms. To fight again for the right to think, to work, to vote, or to love our parents. For the inalienable right to educate our children and raise them by our side, without anyone being able
                    to take them away to take them to a foreign country to educate them in detachment from their family, in hatred of full dignity of man.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here we are to oppose that a foreign totalitarianism with a diabolical doctrine based on hypocrisy and lies become the informer of the Cuban who was always integral, a traitor to which he was always loyal, a servant to the one who was always haughty,
                    master of his destiny.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here we are to fight and die if necessary to prevent caprice from replacing the law; to rescue the sovereignty of the people from the bloody hands of a tyrant.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And from here, from this Villare&#241;a mountain range whose highest summit is decency, we call our compatriots, men and women who love Cuba, who want it clean, haughty, without a master, so they can join the libertarian deed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are no mercenaries here. There are no foreigners here. But Cubans of today who aspire to be like those who set fire to Bayamo, like those who fought in "Las Gu&#225;simas", like those who fell in "Bad Weather" and "the Taironas".
                </p>

                <p>
                    And with us is, enlightening us, the light of our pro-independence heroes, the soul of our marbles, the dignity of our country. With us is the principles of Democracy, the essence of freedom.
                </p>

                <br/>
                <p>
                    To our mothers, may they bless us.
                </p>
                <br/>
                <p>
                    To Cuba, we love her very much, that we are willing to die for her; that we will not stop until we see her again free and sovereign.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    We have only one country: Cuba!<br><br>A single flag: that of the lonely star!<br>
                </p>
                <span>
                    <p>With God and with the country, it is our motto!</p>
