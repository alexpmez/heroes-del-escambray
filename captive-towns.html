                    The captive towns, one of the least known and most painful facts perpetrated by the Cuban dictatorship. The work of journalist Hector Maseda, political prisoner and independent journalist imprisoned during the Black Spring of 2003 was published in three
                    parts in 2001. We reproduce it in full below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These communities, true concentration camps for their builders, were created by the Cuban authorities in order to keep under control and far from their provinces of origin the thousands of peasant collaborators of the armed guerrilla movement that emerged
                    between the years 1960-65, in the mountainous massif of Escambray, in the former province of Las Villas. The exile of these people and their families began in 1970 and did not stop until 1985 with the transfer of the last peasant nucleus
                    that lived in that central region of the country. Fredesvinda Hern&#225;ndez M&#233;ndez (Fredes), a native of Los Quemados, municipality of Manicaragua, was one of the victims of the captive towns, not only because of their religion
                    - he is a Jehovah's Witness - but also because he married the son of a collaborator of the insurgents in those mountainous areas. His father-in-law, Heriberto Hern&#225;ndez Quesada, owned a coffee plantation located in the foothills
                    of the sierra, in G&#252;in&#237;a de Miranda.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "To my father-in-law," -Fredes said,- "the government's political police (DSE or G-2) had him classified as a collaborator of the guerrilla that operated, in the locality between the years 1960-63, he gave them food and allowed them to sleep on their
                    land, and he had done the same with Castro's troops. detained by the DSE, subjected to interrogation and accused of being an enemy of the revolution ".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Six years after the last guerrilla group was liquidated, on December 15, 1971, the political police summoned Heriberto along with hundreds of peasants who, like him, had supported the armed groups opposed to the regime. The intention of the government
                    was to clean the surroundings of the central hills of the country of elements that in the future could support another armed action against the Fidel Castro regime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "So, neighbors of Trinidad, Fomento, G&#252;in&#237;a, La Moza, Manicaragua, Cumanayagua, Barajagua, El Nicho and Jibacoa, -Fredes says,- were involved in the cleaning operation where they were like the trash that had to be disposed of. There were some
                    former guerrillas who were never identified as such, and the officers met with them at the sports stadium in Ciudad Santa Clara.The speech was brief and direct: “We are going to transfer you to other provinces because you are disaffected
                    to the revolution, everyone supported the counterrevolution in Escambray, you do not deserve even the air you breathe. They will never be able to return to the province. What you are going to suffer from this moment, will be suffer
                    by your children and grandchildren, the children of your grandchildren ... “
                </p>

                <p>
                    Immediately, they mounted on a train whose wagons had been converted into small mobile prisons and under strong military custody towards their new destiny: the captive towns that they would build, in their capacity as exiles and prisoners. Forced to work
                    between ten and twelve hours a day, without having the slightest living conditions, poor food, mistreatment of the guards, punishments, beatings, lack of medical attention, no contact with the family.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The trip -according to Fredes- lasted 36 hours, they did not eat anything during the trip. Some arrived at the town of what would be the future Sandino captive town, in the municipality of the same name; others for Briones Montoto, in the Pinar del Río
                    municipality; A third group went to Ram&#243;n L&#243;pez Pe&#241;a, in the municipality of San Crist&#243;bal, all in the westernmost part of the country. The others were sent to Miraflores, in the Camag&#252;ey province. The trips
                    continue one after the other until there was not a peasant left without being displaced from his place of origin.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Relatives would learn about these events months after they occurred, although they began to suffer from the first moment. In this regard, Fredes said: "After two or three months we officially heard from my father-in-law, but the day after the transfer,
                    government officials came to the other farms involved and expropriated all our assets: land, equipment, crops, animals, Many people were expelled from their homes without the government caring what would happen to them from that moment
                    on, most of these families were given a place to stay by friends or family, and mine was lucky, they let them stay in their house. The cuban government look after the women, children and elderly who were evicted, the exact number of
                    families who were dragged into this maelstrom of governmental intolerance is not known. in fact, official figures were not published but is estimated between 2,500 and three thousand peasants were banished and taken to these four captive
                    towns, so that the total victims of this holocaust could amount to ten thousand Cubans, in round figures".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The exiles took an average of two and a half years to build the first houses. The first families moved starting in 1973. The last ones would do it in 1985. The details of these movements will be topics to be dealt with in the second part of this article.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredesvinda, known by Fredes, was transferred in January 1977. She could not conceive at that time the hardships she would have to endure and the obstacles that he had to overcome, not only her but also her youngest daughter who accompanied him in this
                    new adventure imposed by the Castro regime. The exile organized by the Cuban authorities of the Escambray peasants, who supported the anti-Castro insurgent groups between the years 1960-65, also suffered from their relatives due to
                    the intolerance characteristic of this totalitarian regime.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredesvinda Hern&#225;ndez M&#233;ndez (Fredes) tells us about her memories and sufferings of those days that she has wanted to forget so many times, and she does not succeed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The transfer to the new captive towns of the relatives that made up the core of the exiles, was due to a selection made by the Castro government, which carried out its political police (DSE or G-2).
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this regard, Fredes points out: "One morning several military officers showed up at the door of your house, and without preamble they told you that we already had another house assigned in another place, the day of departure and that we had to present
                    ourselves in that address. They added that we did not have to take anything because the buildings were furnished, but this was a lie because the apartments were empty and the officers knew it, some families received credit, so they
                    could leave their things behind but when they arrived at their destination they noticed the lie. My family didn’t believe them, so we bring our belongings with us".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Right after their relatives leave their old domiciles, the buildings were occupied by people identified with the government, who had everything they could find in their interior in gratuitous usufruct.
                </p>

                <p>
                    On this aspect, Fredes recalls: "Those of us who were exiled had to pay rent for the new apartments that for more than two years were built by our leaders in subhuman conditions, the properties that had been confiscated from us, without remuneration had
                    a value several times greater than the cost of the homes assigned in such remote places".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredes had to move on January 21, 1977 for the captive town of Ram&#243;n L&#243;pez Pe&#241;a, in the San Crist&#243;bal municipality of the Pinar del R&#237;o province. "For me the transfer was very hard," he recalls. "I was 20 years old, with a two-year-old
                    girl daughter and pregnant with a second child, and my husband could not accompany me on the trip because his sister (diabetic, deaf and affected by polio since childhood) had suffered a foot injury, it was complicated by gangrene
                    and had to be amputated, I was hospitalized by a serious condition, my husband supported his mother, in short, the movement was made by my brother-in-law, the girl and myself".
                </p>

                <p>
                    "The first stage”, -Fredes said-, "was in trucks from G&#252;in&#237;a de Miranda to the plains of Jibacoa, in Escambray, and other families left the different municipalities, and the places where they housed us did not have the conditions to accommodate
                    older people with children. Women and Men together, without privacy, narrow bunk beds, many without mattresses, My little daughter and I did not fit together in one of them, I could not sleep that night for fear that the girl would
                    fall. The guards gave the children milk and something to eat for the adults. The next day, we were taking in trucks to Manicaragua, we went to El Ranch&#243;n, conditions worsened, there was no place to lie down, they left us without
                    food, and they did not give milk to the children. At dusk, again back to the trucks to Santa Clara, in this city we spent the night without sleep, eaten by mosquitoes, very cold and hit by intermittent drizzles, they placed us in a
                    field by the railway station. There was any type of consideration, despite the fact that we were mostly women, elderly people and children. Most of our men since 1971-72 were imprisoned in different regions of the province of Pinar
                    del Río.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredes, with the anguish reflected in his face by the memories, continues the story: "The next day they put us on the train, the same one that years before had taken our parents, husbands and brothers." They were the small mobile jails and we were accompanied
                    by eight armed guards in each car, with rifles and bayonets, any movement had to be authorized by them, our children were crying with fright and hunger, and at last they gave them milk and compote, oranges were given to the adults.
                    They (the military) knew that we had not eaten for nearly 48 hours, the train journey lasted another 35 hours, no one was given solid food, not even pregnant women or children!".
                </p>

                <p>
                    On that train were the people assigned to the captive towns of L&#243;pez Pe&#241;a, Briones Montoto and Sandino. "As we arrived at the end of the journey, the convoy left the cars and continued its journey until the next stop and so on, until we arrive
                    at the last captive town".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The woman adds: "The transfer of the belongings was another odyssey, we did not know which way they were coming in. Then we found out that they had been sent by a freight train, we had to select which ones were ours in that craze. Some people expressed
                    that this was not their problem, we were the women, the elderly, the children and the few men who accompanied us, helped by the exiles who came to receive us, who moved things in ox carts through irregular roads, the furniture was
                    loosened, the glass broke, the clothes filled with dust or got dirty when falling in the mud and on the dirt".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Displacements like this kept happening until mid-1985 when the last one was made. Fredes force his memory and tells us: "The people who were transferred in this way summed up tens of thousands." In L&#243;pez Pe&#241;a alone, there is a current population
                    of approximately ten thousand people among collaborators of the insurgent groups in the massif of Trinidad, suspected of collaborate and their families, in addition to a few families that constitute the network of permanent government
                    informants who follow in our footsteps.The other three captive towns must have a similar population make up and status".
                </p>

                <p>
                    "When we arrived at the place," Fredes concludes, "we realized that there were only residential buildings, there were no paved streets, no sidewalks, no green areas, no parks, no nurseries, no schools for our children, recreation centers, just one grocery
                    store, another one for clothes, a small square for food and vegetables, the barbershop-hairdresser and the medical post.The authorities considered that it was enough to serve ten thousand people. three houses as elementary schools,
                    Later, when they gave the last inmates a house, they converted the shelter where they lived in primary school.The adolescents who attended the basic secondary had to go to the town of San Crist&#243;bal, located eight or ten kilometers
                    away, most of the time on foot, because there was not transportation in which to move ".
                </p>

                <p>
                    When Fredesvinda Hern&#225;ndez M&#233;ndez arrived at López Peña, there were already about 300 families there. Today that number rises to 2,500. With the passing of time he thought that his situation would improve and that the hatreds of the parties
                    in conflict would remain in the past, but the phrase that Castro's officers told his father-in-law and other political prisoners exiled when they were concentrated in the city of Santa Clara , on December 15, 1971, it was not said
                    to be forgotten. In reality, it formed and forms part of the socio-political and economic treatment that the Fidel Castro government has reserved for anyone who, in any way, opposes it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Confinement, although it occurs with regular appearances, is never exempt from its abusive and cruel character. But when it extends indefinitely to tens of thousands of innocent people of the same nationality as the rulers who impose it, then it acquires
                    the connotation of crime of citizenship.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredesvinda Hern&#225;ndez M&#233;ndez (Fredes) makes an effort to remember if, with the passing of time, the living conditions of the residents in the captive towns have improved.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "It is true," she says, "that since 1978 the Cuban state improved them a little, the main streets were paved and paved sidewalks, the access roads between buildings, formerly of dirt, were replaced by prefabricated cement slabs. some green areas and two
                    or three grocery stores and clothes expanded the medical post and its specialties, turning it into a clinic, They inaugurated a small video room and a common area for the population to hold their parties, Regularized the supply of
                    drinking water In addition, they built a primary school, a secondary school and a nursery school, all of which were carried out by our imprisoned relatives, forced to work as slaves".
                </p>

                <p>
                    "However," says Fredes, "we do not have libraries, theaters, cultural centers, museums, exhibition halls, training schools for skilled workers or medium technicians, transportation is almost nil, we only have trucks that cover the route. San Crist&#243;bal-L&#243;pez
                    Pe&#241;a, every hour, until four o'clock in the afternoon, as of that moment we are incommunicado, there is also a small bus, with twenty seats, which covers two trips a day to Havana, but is usually outside the city. This is all
                    that a population of ten thousand or more inhabitants has".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The woman continues declaring: "Of course, we have an dirt road as the only entrance and exit to the town, which the government has not wanted to pave, extending for two or three kilometers to the Havana-Pinar del R&#237;o highway. The rest of the year,
                    dust and dirt will not let us live, we are surrounded by mountains and savannahs everywhere, and the nearest town (San Crist&#243;bal) is located about 15 kilometers away".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another aspect in the life of the exiles is the permanent vigilance. The visits of the political police (DSE or G-2) are periodic and the appointments to their offices are constant. "We are monitored 24 hours a day by the DSE, they see us every week or
                    they mention us in San Crist&#243;bal, where the seat of the police organ is located, we can not strengthen relations or exchange meetings with other neighbors without running the risk of being accused, In this building there are three
                    or four families of confidants, DSE officers and confidants meet every week at the high school premises to exchange reports and give new instructions. As can be perceived with don’t have a normal life, neither socially nor individually".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The vicissitudes of the exiles are not only present in the observation, control and police threats, but are also manifested in the economic-labor and political aspects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredes affirms: "And as if this were not enough, we are subject to a systematic labor and economic discrimination.The lack of political trust that the totalitarian State exercises over us limits us access to jobs of greater responsibility and better salaries.
                    This official procedure extends equally to our children and grandchildren, nor does it approve the requests we make to the municipal government, to allow us to work on our own as provided by law and, in this way, get a few cents more
                    for family benefit, so the authorities punish us not only to exile but also to indigence".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another issue that Fredes refers to is the government's effort to add the residents of the captive towns to the corral of the lambs. "They try to force families to participate in acts of support for the regime, most of us refuse, some descendants of the
                    exiles have joined the political process imposed by Castro in good faith or opportunism, but in general they do not submit to the deception. They know that in their homeland has no future, their parents and grandparents are magnificent
                    examples of this, which is why many request in the SINA (North American Interests Section in Cuba) political refuge to leave to the United States. Those of us that were not accepted by the Refugee Department and were working in any
                    state agency, the political and mass organizations of the center prepare acts of repudiation, and they are expelled us from the job. None of the banished families are allowed to move to the provinces of Villa Clara, Sancti Spíritus
                    or Cienfuegos, next to the Escambray".

                    It is public knowledge that since the years 1960-65, when armed insurgent movements proliferated against the government of Fidel Castro in the different mountainous areas of the country, the DSE infiltrated agents within these groups to neutralize them
                    in one way or another.

                <p>
                    Fredes does not lose the opportunity to expose his experiences, after some years of necessarily coexisting with these individuals.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Many of the government agents infiltrated the guerrillas - the woman points out - were captured, tried and sentenced apparently by military courts in summary trials, and then, and with a strong endorsement, send them to the United States as political
                    refugees. Some of the surviving collaborators and former guerrillas, were banished to the captive towns, and have remained as such since then. We know that preparing a good intelligence agent requires years of work and great sacrifices.
                    Caastro prepares them well, but also commits serious errors, I have witnessed the effrontery with which these individuals have proceeded once the political asylum was granted by the US government, and these gentlemen have dared to
                    celebrate farewell parties in their homes on the eve of their departure, together with several of the officers of the DSE that we know well, for being the same ones that harass us on a daily basis. Their mission which we doubt can
                    success, is to carry out intelligence work in favor of Castroism in the United States".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The residents of the four captive towns live in similar conditions, to a greater or lesser degree than those described by Fredes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "None of the residents of the captive towns that live in the above-mentioned situation can feel happy in these places, where we are subjected daily to the most refined psychic-physical tortures that can occur to unbalanced minds. The same situation is
                    observed among the neighbors of other captive towns, we know this because we maintain certain connections and relationships with them outside of these concentration and exile camps, We exchange information and often tell ourselves
                    about our most unpleasant experiences in these bleak places, where we are forced to live and die".
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fredes concluded: "Here there are no barbed wire or armed soldiers that limit our movements, but we are locked in a different, ultramodern jail, in which prison discipline, fences and guards are programmed into our minds. Is like magnetic rings have been
                    placed in the necks of the convicts and these will be tightened as we move away from the people, pressure that can reach suffocation".
                </p>

                <p>
                    The truth is that the victims of this ostracism should feel like lab animals, whom unscrupulous scientists submit to the most varied tests to see how far the human being is able to resist the extreme cruelty of their rulers.
