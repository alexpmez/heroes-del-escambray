                            Tom&#225;s San Gil was called by Castro’s army as Escambray's Strongest Arm, and rightly so. Under his command the supply line was increased, more uprisings were made, and the guerrilla struggle intensified, carrying out numerous combat actions against
                            the Castro forces.

                            According to the regime's publications, the San Gil guerrilla group was attributed - in a period of eleven months, the losses of fifty-four soldiers of the Castro army, and the burning and destruction of two buses and thirty-six buildings, including tobacco
                            curing houses, cooperative stores and government warehouses.

                            Tomasito San Gil was a young guy of strong physical constitution, immensely brave and endowed with a great sense of organization. Although when he took up arms in September 1960, he lacked military training, Tomasito became guerrilla chief in the heat
                            of combat. A natural strategist, he was chosen by Commander Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez, as Second Chief of the National Liberation Army. In his time as a guerrilla, from 1960 to 1963, he proved to be a fighter of the first line and
                            as Guerrillas Commander he was much loved by his troops. When he turned 23, the men in the supply line sent a cake and snacks to the bush to celebrate his birthday.

                            Today, guerrillas who survived the peasant war, speak of Tom&#225;s San Gil with reverence and admiration. These ex-guerrillas tell that in a combat, he was the first to attack, and in a encirclement, the last one to escape.

                            San Gil was surrounded in an area called Monte de las Cuarenta Caballerías. At dusk and with less than thirty men, Tom&#225;s San Gil faced several enemy battalions, trying to break the encirclement, while the Castro troops tightened the knot. The rattle
                            of the VZ was mixed with the shots of FAL, M-3, of Garands and M52, the grenades illuminated the night and bright lights cut through the darkness. On either side, the rebels tried to cross into the open field, while the curses
                            and shouts were heard between the shots.

                            Tom&#225;s San Gil with several of his men broke the encirclement, when still behind him you could heard the rattle of weapons. His lieutenant Nilo Armando Saavedra Gil, known by Mandy Florencia, was trapped in the military ring. San Gil penetrated the
                            encirclement again, trying to rescue him.

                            At dawn on March 1, 1963, the combat ended. Tomasito San Gil, Mandy Florencia and eleven others were left laying on the battlefield. The LCB and the militia counted twenty-seven casualties.

                            Romulo Rodriguez was the only guerrilla that was in the troop of San Gil that night that managed to survive the deed of the Escambray.

                               : The combat began at around nine in the evening and lasted until dawn. They were thousands and we were twenty-six. I had an M-2 carbine that had an expired dock and had manually insert each single bullet. That's how badly armed we were. The enemy fire illumination and everything turn as if it were daytime. We tried to break the encirclement, and there was a moment when that was shooting at point-blank. Tomasito broke the siege and could have escaped but returned to help several of us who were in a difficult situation. Tomasito died of a bullet to the head. Nilo Armando Saavedra - who was second in command - died of a bullet to the chest.
