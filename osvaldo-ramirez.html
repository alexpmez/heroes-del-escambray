                            Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez was captain of the rebel army in the fight against Batista. Unhappy with the communist turn of the triumphant revolution, the struggle against it began, he was considered the most audacious guerrilla of the Escambray. While other
                            guerrilla leaders had been waiting under orders not to fight, Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez had organized his guerrilla squads into combat units, attacking and harassing the enemy at every opportunity. Without waiting for weapons, with
                            nonexistent resources, in a few weeks Ram&#237;rez became the best-known guerrilla fighter in the hills of Las Villas.

                            Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez was a fibrous peasant, toasted by the sun of the Sierra. He was born on July 6, 1921 in Guayos, near Sancti Spíritus, province of Las Villas. He worked as a truck driver for the sugar mills and later became a rental driver. In 1958
                            he rose in the Escambray against Batista. After the triumph of the Revolution, Ram&#237;rez was promoted to captain of the National Revolutionary Police, assigned to a position of supervision in the province of Matanzas. In
                            the summer of 1960, he rose again in the Escambray after the combat at the Sitio de Juana.

                            Shortly after rising, Ram&#237;rez was captured by a military unit. When he was transferred for interrogation, this risk taker guerrilla leader launched himself into a ravine, in front of the surprised eyes of his captors. The jump towards a high precipice,
                            was a suicidal action. But the guerrilla of Guayos was lucky. The dense weeds and the branches of the trees stopped their vertiginous fall. Bruised and with his body covered with wounds, Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez fled through the
                            brush, while a squad of soldiers, astonished at his suicidal courage, watched him flee from the top of the ravine. That audacity was the seal of Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez. From the beginning of the guerrilla struggle. Ram&#237;rez
                            was always the warrior of the mountain, born for combat.

                            In a public appearance, Fidel Castro offered amnesty to Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez, saying demagogically: "We want to convince them that they are wrong, and if Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez deposes his weapons, we will guarantee his life." From the Sierra del Escambray,
                            the response was typical of the hero guerrilla: "If Castro wants to speak, let him lay down his arms and go up to the Escambray. We will guarantee your life. "Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez answered in a clandestine interview.

                            The guerrilla leader Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez survived dozens of encirclements. He became for Castro's army, the most coveted prey. In the month of April, Ram&#237;rez was betrayed by Filiberto Cabrera Carranza, known by Pancho el Grande, a diminutive employee
                            of the Meyer hospital. When hundreds of militiamen surrounded the guerrilla camp in Las Aromas de Velázquez, intense fighting ensued. Little by little, to the fire of the machine guns VZ and PPCha, the militia closed the knot.
                            Again, Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez, the most wanted guerrilla of the Escambray, vanished in the brush, mocking the fence.

                            A few hours later, in a nearby glen, a corporal of militias detected a movement in a thicket. The corporal, a freckled blond man nicknamed El Yanqui, fired a shot into the glen. The solitary lead found a body: that of the Chief Maximum of the Escambray
                            guerrillas. On April 16, 1962, Osvaldo Ram&#237;rez, the only guerrilla fighter to whom Castro had offered amnesty if he laid down his arms, was dying. Today, his body rests in an unknown grave on Cuban soil.
